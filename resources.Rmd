##  IRC Access 
Please work with your mentor(s) to ensure you have a plan to get on and off base
each day.  We recommend having the contact information for a few people who can
help you out in a pinch.  

## Getting Around
[TheBus](https://www.thebus.org/) serves all of Oahu, with stops near the 
entrance to Ford Island.  There's also a [Skyline (rail)](https://www.honolulu.gov/dts/skyline/home/)
stop near Ford Island, although Skyline serves a limited portion of the island.

[Biki](https://gobiki.org/) bikeshare is available downtown, in Waikiki, and in
Mānoa.  

## Convenient Neighborhoods
Ford Island is most easily accessible via public transportation if you live in 
the Salt Lake, Pearl City, or Aiea neighborhoods.  

The University of Hawaii main campus is in Mānoa.  Depending on traffic, Mānoa is
anywhere from a 20-minute (off-peak) to hour-plus (peak commute) drive from
Ford Island.
