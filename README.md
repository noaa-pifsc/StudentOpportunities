## For Committee Members
The easiest way to update the [Student Opportunities GitHub Page](https://noaa-pifsc.github.io/StudentOpportunities/)
is with RStudio.  RStudio is approved NOAA/NMFS software that is both Windows-
and Mac-compatible.  

You will also need a PIFSC enterprise GitHub account.  [This site](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/nmfs-st-github-governance-team/faq)
(*internal to NOAA*) will help you get set up.  Once you have your account, you'll
need to connect your GitHub account with RStudio.  The same folks who get you
your account can help you with this.  

Once you've got RStudio on your computer and interacting with your enterprise 
GitHub account, you're ready to work with the GitHub Page.  Exciting!

The very first step is to connect your computer to this repository (or repo).  You
only need to do this once.  There are several ways to do this.  Here's one:  
Click the green "Code" button above: ![green code button](images/Code.png) and
copy the URL in the dialogue box that appears.  Now go to RStudio and select:
File > New Project > Version Control > Git  
Paste the URL as the Repository URL.  Name the project something that makes sense 
to you (perhaps, StudentOpportunities).  Put the project somewhere on your computer
that makes sense to you.  Best practice to is to click the box that says, "Open 
in a new session".  Click Create Project.  Voila!  Everything in this repository
is now on your computer and you're ready to get editing.

Further instructions forthcoming.

This ReadMe is written in Markdown.  Checkout this [quick reference](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) 
and the links therein to get started.  

The GitHub Page is written in RMarkdown, which is pretty similar to Markdown but
is specific to R.  [This reference](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/rmarkdown.html) 
will get you started.

[HappyGitWithR](https://happygitwithr.com/) is very handy when you need a reminder
of how to do something with GitHub and RStudio and when things go sideways.
